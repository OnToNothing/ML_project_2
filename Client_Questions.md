### Questions for client 

This will serve as a list of questions that we will ask the client: 

* What is the goal of the project? 
* Are there specific outcomes or metrics of success you have in mind?
* What is the data/where is the data from? 
* Any other data that you have access to? 
* Are there specific features or functionality you envision being particularly valuable?
* What level of accuracy or other performance metrics (precision, recall) are expected?
* Is there a tolerance for false positives or false negatives, and if so, how much?
* are there any previous solutions that have been tried?
